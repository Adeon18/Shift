# Shift
Shift is a modern flexible Vulkan renderer that is designed to be simple, effective and easily extendable

Right now is in a very much dev state so it will build crossplatform but might not run.

Set VULKAN_SDK_PATH in .env.cmake as path to your VulkanSDK and then cmake should do all the work(soon will be able to do even Vulkan)
